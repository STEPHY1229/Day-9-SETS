#set is an unordered, semi-mutable and not allow duplicate values.
#subset is the set os main set.
#superset is the main set.
#union = merging of two sets
#intersection = common numbers
#difference = removes same element and prints remaining elements
#update = prints the updated value only (removes old one)
#symmetric difference = deletes common values
#difference update = prints the different elements
#intersection update = prints the same elements and it is updated
#symmetric difference update = same elements deleted and prints other values and it is updated
#pop() = removes first element, pop(10) = error, because we shouldn't give number directly so use remove
#remove = removes particular element no indexing
#copy = copies the same data
#clear = removes every element and prints (set())
#add = adds element to set and prints({70})
#len = prints length of set
#doesn't have count,index
#discard = delets given number
#isdisjoint = prints boolean output
